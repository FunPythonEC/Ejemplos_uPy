# Asyncio Examples

Here you will find some Jupyter Notebooks where almost every `asyncio` oriented method is tested.

Based on: [MicroPython Asyncio](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md)

Also everything made here, has been using Jupyter with micropython, for that you must install jupyter and the following kinda extension: [Jupyter uPy](https://github.com/goatchurchprime/jupyter_micropython_kernel), or you can also just copy the code from the notebooks and run them in your favorite IDE.
